# Smartfashion 2.0

## TODO 
- SVM implementation works, but tbh I don't really know what it's doing 
- compares against a 'labels' matrix, and the input matrix has to be of same size as training matrices?  
- i don't understand 

## Environment Setup
### OpenCV
- Python 2.7.x __x86__
- Numpy 1.14.2 (can't remember if ver is important)
- Skimage
- OpenCV __2__ (!!!! IMPORTANT)
